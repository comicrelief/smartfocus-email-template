## How to use the template:

The email template consists of rows that can be used in our emails. 
 - Each row is surrounded by comments in capitals denoting the start and the end of the row.
 - Within each row there are extra comments with instructions where to change colour, fonts etc.

There are parts to an email that should always be copied in: 
- Everything above the comment  ROWS START HERE
- Make sure the email starts with [EMV TEXTPART] and [EMV HTMLPART] tags (needed for SmartFocus)
- The FOOTER row and everything below

Between the ROWS START HERE comment and the ROWS END HERE comment rows can be added in different order.
However, you'd always have the FOOTER row as last row and you'd normally begin with the PRE-HEADER, LOGO and NAVIGATION rows.
